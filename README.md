1. R's Shiny Visualization:
* This is my [Shiny App R](https://ba0tb1-megan-le.shinyapps.io/RShiny_Texas/)
* The challenge I encountered in this deployment was that I didn't realize that you could write directly in the console within Postit Cloud. Once I figured out that was possible, then I just followed the steps listed in the [deployment directions](https://docs.posit.co/shinyapps.io/getting-started.html#working-with-shiny-for-python) and was able to successfully connect my shinyapps.io account, click down the publish options menu, select that I wanted to publish my app to the shinyapp.io account and not the postit cloud.
* Also I had trouble with the initial dataset I chose (Florida) so I went back to the [CDC website](https://data.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-County-Data-20/swc5-untb) and extracted a new dataset (Texas) and that ended up working.
